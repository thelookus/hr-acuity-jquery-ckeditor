# CKEditor 5 Integration Notes

## Integration Approach
- Replaced Bootstrap WYSIWYG with CKEditor 5 using React integration
- Maintained existing jQuery structure for post listing and data handling
- Integrated React component only for the editor functionality
- Preserved localStorage data flow and post structure

## Technical Decisions
- Used CKEditor 5 Classic build for its simplicity and essential features
- Implemented React component wrapper to isolate editor functionality
- Kept jQuery for existing functionality to minimize changes
- Used GPL license for development purposes

## Technical Tradeoffs
- Chose GPL license over commercial license for development, may need to be changed for production
- Used Classic build instead of custom build to speed up implementation, but with less flexibility
- Maintained localStorage for data persistence instead of implementing a new storage solution

## Testing
- Implemented basic test suite using Vitest
- Added test for content persistence and retrieval
- Mocked localStorage for reliable testing
- Focused on core functionality: saving and retrieving posts with formatted content

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
2. Start development server: `pnpm start`
3. Access application at http://localhost:5173/
4. Run tests: `pnpm test`

## Additional Notes
- Editor includes basic formatting (bold, italic, underline) and list support
- Error handling implemented for better user experience
- Content persistence maintained through existing localStorage mechanism
- No changes required to existing build process
